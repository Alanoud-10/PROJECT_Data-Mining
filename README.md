**Project Description:**
This project aims to build a predictive model for detecting panic attacks based on medical data that includes several influential factors such as
age, stress level, heart rate, temperature, sleep hours, anxiety level, and physical activity. By analyzing this data, the project will help predict panic attacks early,
contributing to timely medical intervention and improving the health of individuals suffering from this condition. The dataset used is the "Panic Attack Dataset," available on Kaggle.

**Project Motivation:**
This project was chosen because it addresses a common issue that affects many peopleâ€”panic attacks. 
These attacks have significant negative effects on daily life, and early detection can help provide the necessary support and treatment.
Through this project, I aim to predict panic attacks based on various health and psychological factors, 
ultimately improving medical interventions and helping individuals affected by this condition lead better lives.
